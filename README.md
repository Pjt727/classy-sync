# Overview
This is a WIP syncing tool for [classy](https://github.com/Pjt727/classy.git).
It provides a simple interface to sync data from **classy** into the data store of your choice.

# Supported Datastores
Each datastore may support several granularity options for getting data from classy:
- **all** - gets every exposed data point at each sync
- **school** - choose which school(s) to sync
- **term** -  choose which term(s) to sync
- **compatiblity** - ability to switch between granularity options
    - ‚úÖ full support
    - üü† some support (e.i. term sync level to school level syncs keeping the same db)
    - ‚ùå no support
